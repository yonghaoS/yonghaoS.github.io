I am currently a second-year PhD student at Simon Fraser University, conducting research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the iXLab.  
My work sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Materials, and AI technologies.  
I regularly publish in top-tier HCI venues such as CHI, UIST, and UbiComp.

He is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology.
